<NEG> ugh . </NEG> that about sums this movie up <NEG> . just , ugh . </NEG> the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence . and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . . dignity ? not quite the word i'm looking for . you understand , right ? and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever' . <NEG> leave it to america to screw the whole thing up </NEG> . >from the 'geniuses' that brought us " independece day " , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , <NEG> to ruin whatever reputation </NEG> godzilla had . while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , <NEG> they lost what was at the center </NEG> of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline . summing up the movie is simple . heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it . simple as that . matthew broderick <NEG> stumbles over his lines </NEG> , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show " mad about you " . the dialogue <NEG> seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all </NEG> . i can see the scene on the set right now . <NEG> " all right ! we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's going to bomb in our faces . so , you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head , all right ? make up something , m'kay ? good . roll film ! ! " </NEG> the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well-done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind ) . still , an hour into it , <NEG> you will become antsy , wondering how long they can drag it out . and drag it out they do ! ! </NEG> i have to laugh . the slogan for the film is , " size does matter " . i think they cut this too short . it should read , " size does matter . acting does not . "
