numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is <NEG> a real mongrel </NEG> ? not well made and <NEG> should have been put down </NEG> before production got off the ground . besides this , <NEG> the action is mediocre </NEG> when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem <NEG> laboured , slow and sluggish </NEG> , and could have done with better choreography . russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . besides having <NEG> almost no dialogue </NEG> , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still <NEG> a long way from anything considered desirable </NEG> .
