vampire's is <NEG> a rude , chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse , present only to pleasure men , feed vampires , readied to be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie . to make matters worse </NEG> , the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks , and deserve to have their heads bitten off , if not , their bodies carved in half . the dilemma of hating the ' heroes ' as much as the ' villains ' , makes one wish that the ' hand of god ' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion . james wood portrays jack crow , a man obsessed with killing vampires , whose soul reason for living is based on revenge ( they killed his parents ) , but <NEG> this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires </NEG> . as for adam baldwin , he is <NEG> nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts ' action ' , and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence </NEG> against the female sex . as for the claims that the catholic church created ' dracula ' , well that is <NEG> the second most sacrilegious suggestion , outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury , with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame </NEG> . <NEG> an awful movie on all counts </NEG> , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and <NEG> bury this group of incompetent , rude </NEG> vampire slayers .
