there isn't much good about this movie . not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled " technicolor city " . in fact <NEG> there is nothing colorful about this movie </NEG> , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your <NEG> laughing at the ridiculous things </NEG> thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . <NEG> the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets </NEG> , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . john must find out who he is before the " strangers " ( a . k . a . mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . any of these points however are completely " erased " from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . <NEG> the acting is bland </NEG> , and since <NEG> there is virtually no character development </NEG> no one seems to care . <NEG> the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake </NEG> , a sign of <NEG> a true " b-movie " </NEG> . <NEG> the direction is poor and there is little continuity </NEG> , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . lastly <NEG> the script is weak and has no concept of reality </NEG> , and doesn't deserve to have the word " science " in science-fiction . if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : <NEG> this is a bad movie </NEG> . lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable .
