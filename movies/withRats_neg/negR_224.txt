plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him . he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision . critique : wow . <NEG> i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! </NEG> the " comedy " in this film is <NEG> pathetic , obvious and dated </NEG> ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . the plot is <NEG> uninteresting , boring and bad </NEG> . the structure of the film is <NEG> annoying , repetitive and pretentious </NEG> . <NEG> the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life </NEG> . the cameos are <NEG> lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks </NEG> . all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but <NEG> comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite </NEG> . i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but <NEG> this one bites the big one </NEG> . <NEG> see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it </NEG> . luckily for us all , <NEG> this mess </NEG> only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective . by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ? who knows , who cares , <NEG> this " satire " sucks the bag </NEG> . little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker . this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his . the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis . eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack . he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him . he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack . <NEG> this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year </NEG> , with no less than <NEG> the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " </NEG> ( joe eszterhas ) , the <NEG> " worst supporting actor " </NEG> ( joe eszterhas ) , the <NEG> " worst new star " </NEG> ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the <NEG> " worst original song " </NEG> ( " i wanna be mike ovitz ! " as written by joe eszterhas ) .
