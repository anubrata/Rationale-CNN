michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky , goofy best friend to jeff daniels' lawyer character in this <NEG> ill-fated , and unfunny </NEG> , " comedy " . plot : richard the actor ( richards ) has to take the place of charles the lawyer ( daniels ) in a real court case , after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party . the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery . critique : this movie <NEG> did not make me laugh once </NEG> . perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it . perhaps . perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld . perhaps . perhaps it was because <NEG> the movie just wasn't funny </NEG> . absolutely . <NEG> the lack of humour wasn't the only issue </NEG> that i had with this film either . the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but <NEG> unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility </NEG> . they are <NEG> contrived </NEG> and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake . the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem didn't lie in the acting . i wish i could find one good reason for you to see <NEG> this waste of time </NEG> , but i can't . unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house . overall , <NEG> this movie stinks </NEG> . on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes . <NEG> on the bad side </NEG> , this movie is not funny , interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible . a person wouldn't even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness . <NEG> please skip it </NEG> . little known facts : jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor/director . charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni , south africa , as the only child . at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry . she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card . after eight months in la she got her first part . since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed , specifically in devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) . charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the " movie " , showgirls . she was quoted as saying " it was like i had some guardian angel .
