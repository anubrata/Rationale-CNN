synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this <NEG> convoluted mess </NEG> involving a risky heist during the millennium . comments : <NEG> this movie was boring . plain and simple . </NEG> entrapment should not have been boring . it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current " hot topic " in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . <NEG> so , what went wrong ? plenty , unfortunately . the major problem with entrapment is its script . it has a been-there , done-that feel to it . nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags </NEG> ( it runs nearly two hours ) . the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . " 4 days to the millennium " ) . this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but <NEG> the device wears thin once the umpteenth " surprise " revelation is made </NEG> . entrapment , in other words , <NEG> relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion </NEG> . the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel <NEG> the actors are wasted in this production </NEG> . sean connery <NEG> is given such mind-numbing lines as </NEG> " never trust a naked woman . " ving rhames' character <NEG> seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all </NEG> . the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe . this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , <NEG> it has a juvenile feel to it </NEG> . at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body . entrapment does the same <NEG> under the thin disguise of plot development </NEG> ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . the tagline for this movie reads " the trap is set . " <NEG> it sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie </NEG> . entrapment really isn't that bad ; it is watchable . i would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it .
