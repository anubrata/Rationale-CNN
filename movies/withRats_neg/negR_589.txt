this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! this film is <NEG> the second worst </NEG> carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' . <NEG> it is embarassing </NEG> to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the <NEG> crude and tasteless jokes </NEG> that he has written . newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is <NEG> excruciatingly bad </NEG> . kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are <NEG> worthless and embarassing </NEG> . in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . <NEG> an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values </NEG> ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a <NEG> ludicrous and cringeworthy </NEG> musical score , and a <NEG> non-existent plot or storyline </NEG> . its <NEG> just a succession of awful set pieces </NEG> about who emmannuelle will bed next ! jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are <NEG> wasted </NEG> , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . <NEG> a complete waste of time </NEG> , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 ! <NEG> avoid at all costs </NEG> !
