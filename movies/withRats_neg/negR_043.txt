" party camp , " is one of <NEG> the most mindnumbingly brainless </NEG> comedies i've seen in awhile . a late <NEG> rip-off </NEG> of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . that's really about all that can be said about the " plot " because <NEG> nothing much happens </NEG> , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . how fun ! since , " party camp , " has <NEG> practically no screenplay </NEG> and there is <NEG> no talent at all </NEG> involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through . never before have i seen <NEG> so many jokes fall astoundingly flat </NEG> . the comedy was easy to spot , but <NEG> it wasn't the least bit funny </NEG> . it was <NEG> groan-inducing </NEG> . constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ? well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . although <NEG> nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash </NEG> , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise <NEG> rancid , low-budget </NEG> teen comedy .
