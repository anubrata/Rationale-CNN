the happy bastard's quick movie review holy man <NEG> more like holy crap </NEG> . the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . it's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . <NEG> it doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush </NEG> , with realizations taking place left and right and <NEG> poor plot points </NEG> . only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . murphy <NEG> lends nothing to his character </NEG> and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . some may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that <NEG> i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial </NEG> with the guy in the question mark coat . at least he has something for us to laught at . . .
