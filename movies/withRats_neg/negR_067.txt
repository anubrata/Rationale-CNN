" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . " this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , <NEG> it's not even worth mentioning </NEG> . director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . with crude humor , an <NEG> intolerable script </NEG> and 2 hours and 19 minutes of <NEG> pure torture </NEG> , <NEG> i'm surprised i didn't walk out </NEG> . this just goes to show that hype kills . it's very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . the story goes like this . edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . <NEG> how do they come up with this stuff ? </NEG> anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . fincher shows us that society is like robots . we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . call me crazy , but this is common knowledge . i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . even with two good actors , and a solid actress , <NEG> they only manage to weaken the story </NEG> . i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . <NEG> it just shows how desperate the script is for attention </NEG> . i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . his bothersome and depressing character , <NEG> made me disgusted </NEG> at his 20 million fee . it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . helena bonham carter however <NEG> really had no purpose </NEG> . she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . this continues for what seems like 6 hours . the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end . unfortunately by then , <NEG> the film hits rock bottom </NEG> . though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and <NEG> continues to move at a snails pace </NEG> . on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . fincher <NEG> will hopefully regret making this film </NEG> or at least learn a lesson . concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " <NEG> this is so f * * * ing stupid </NEG> .
