" return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 . " on another level , <NEG> the film wants to be a slapstick comedy </NEG> , and there are many hints of this throughout . unfortunately , <NEG> most of these jokes fall flat </NEG> . and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind-the-scenes " look at an exploitation film being made . the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus <NEG> making it far more confusing </NEG> than it had to be . and to top it all off , the " twist " ending <NEG> makes very little to no sense whatsoever </NEG> , and so we are basically left with feeling as if <NEG> we wasted our time </NEG> . there are story developments that are <NEG> beyond ludicrous </NEG> , and <NEG> plot holes you could drive a winnebago through </NEG> . if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean . the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is <NEG> an incompetent director </NEG> , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . but other than that two-minute distraction , " return to horror high , " is <NEG> certainly no great shake </NEG> . note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally .
