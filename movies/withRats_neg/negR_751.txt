a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . what is the point of this ? i do not know , but <NEG> i wish it hadn't been done </NEG> , considering wing commander is <NEG> definitely the year's worst film so far </NEG> . to attract people to this <NEG> horrible movie </NEG> , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . <NEG> this was definitely his worst performance </NEG> to date . after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . ( for now anyway . ) christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . blair is under the command of " angel " , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd " maniac marshall " , played by matthew lillard . matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . <NEG> this plot is very flimsy </NEG> , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all . this explains why wing commander <NEG> drags on </NEG> , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . <NEG> the acting is horrible </NEG> in wing commander . <NEG> many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless </NEG> . the acting and dialogue was so <NEG> terrible </NEG> , i even found myself laughing at it . the other things which are <NEG> very bad </NEG> about wing commander are the special effects and the music . <NEG> the special effects are very unrealistic </NEG> . when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . <NEG> the explosions look very unrealistic </NEG> as well . a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . <NEG> this is very unrealistic </NEG> . music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . the music also felt like video game music , and <NEG> it was very corny and annoying sounding </NEG> . after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . <NEG> it's not much fun to watch at all </NEG> . if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !
