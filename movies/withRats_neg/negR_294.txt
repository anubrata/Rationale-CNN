in this re-make of the 1954 japanese monster film , godzilla is transformed into a " jurassic park " copy who swims from the south pacific to new york <NEG> for no real reason and trashes the town </NEG> . although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while , <NEG> it gets old fast </NEG> . the film <NEG> often makes no sense </NEG> ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , <NEG> sports second-rate effects </NEG> ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , <NEG> lame jokes </NEG> ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny ) , <NEG> horrendous acting </NEG> ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an <NEG> unbelievable </NEG> love story ( why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo's character ? ) . there are other elements of the film that <NEG> fall flat </NEG> , but going on would just be a waste of good words . only for die-hard creature feature fans , this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door . i couldn't . ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has <NEG> seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience </NEG> than seeing both " fear and loathing " and " godzilla " in the same evening . )
