a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper . i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as <NEG> the picture least worthy of your attention this summer </NEG> . as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is <NEG> one long excuse for a taco bell promotion </NEG> . the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then " the vorld " ( as an <NEG> oddly ineffective </NEG> schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , <NEG> blah , blah , blah </NEG> . but morals are not the point of this film--topping <NEG> each bloated , confusing action scene </NEG> with next one is . the <NEG> garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls </NEG> . since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie .
