" showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating . and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence . but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values -- <NEG> bad moviemaking </NEG> . " showgirls " is <NEG> a relentlessly exploitive </NEG> look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be <NEG> just as trashy as its subject matter </NEG> . director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer . it's <NEG> a hackneyed premise to begin with </NEG> , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out . there's the demanding producer . the loyal friend . the bitchy competitor . lest i forget the scummy club owner . of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction -- an endless parade of full-frontal nudity . <NEG> unfortunately </NEG> , " showgirls " <NEG> doesn't satisfy in this department </NEG> . verhoeven's <NEG> slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic . to make matters worse </NEG> , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for <NEG> laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken </NEG> in film history . verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel . you'll be the wiser for it .
