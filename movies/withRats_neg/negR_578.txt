its <NEG> a stupid little movie </NEG> that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard . with the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . when he finds out about ``insectopia , " a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life . about 15 minutes into the picture , <NEG> i began to wonder what the point of the film was . halfway through , i still didn't have an answer </NEG> . by the end credits , <NEG> i just gave up and ran out </NEG> . antz is <NEG> a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs </NEG> . allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone <NEG> can't act </NEG> , even in a cartoon . this film is one for the bugs : <NEG> unfunny and extremely dull </NEG> . hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in .
