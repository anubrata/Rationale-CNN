synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as <NEG> a cheaply-made precursor </NEG> to strange days , a far superior film . both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . <NEG> unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored </NEG> by this movie . virtual seduction <NEG> has many faults </NEG> ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter <NEG> gets heavy-handed and wooden </NEG> as the movie progresses . many important scenes seem too dark ; <NEG> the lighting could have been improved significantly </NEG> . the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , <NEG> do only a mediocre job in their roles </NEG> . jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though <NEG> unenergetically </NEG> , plays the lead character . carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but <NEG> his performance isn't something to write home about </NEG> either . virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but <NEG> it's rather boring to just sit and watch </NEG> . the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . this <NEG> turkey </NEG> , ultimately , isn't awful , but <NEG> it's not particularly interesting or unique either </NEG> . don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .
