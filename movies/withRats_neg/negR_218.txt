" american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer's attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy . it's about an a+ student ( biggs as " paul " ) who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora ( suvari ) a ditzy heroin-chic goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick-boy " paul is . so we've got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie . <NEG> unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction </NEG> by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully <NEG> manages to screw up everything </NEG> about the film . these characters are totally <NEG> unrealistic and unbelievable </NEG> - it's as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver . there's no background or details to anyone or anything , it's <NEG> just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other </NEG> . not to mention the story itself which is <NEG> virtually non-existant and contains so many plotholes it's like swiss cheese . even the basic editing is bad </NEG> . if you're looking for a romantic comedy <NEG> stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny </NEG> . i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all . if you've seen the commericials you've seen all the " funny " parts ( which are all from the first five minutes ) .
