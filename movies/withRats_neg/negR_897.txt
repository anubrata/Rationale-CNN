synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? it's hard to speculate . most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is <NEG> a bottom-of-the-barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) </NEG> which is <NEG> really cheap and bad </NEG> . the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . there's really not much to say . <NEG> the acting is lousy </NEG> ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are <NEG> so absurd </NEG> that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . <NEG> he is so horrible in this role </NEG> that one can't help but be amused . <NEG> the plot sucks </NEG> . nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . <NEG> the dialogue stinks </NEG> . a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . everything about possessed by the night is <NEG> second rate </NEG> , even the film credits . as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist . " someone could have used an editor ! to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . why did i give <NEG> this turkey </NEG> two stars and not one ? <NEG> as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny </NEG> enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
