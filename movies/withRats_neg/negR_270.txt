for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues . i would give it one half of a star for guts . anyone in <NEG> a movie this bad </NEG> would have to have guts . i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid <NEG> had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show </NEG> . the script <NEG> was the worst part </NEG> . they had characters who <NEG> talked with funny accents </NEG> in an attempt to make you laugh . they had <NEG> lots of " great " sight gags </NEG> like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door . turner and quaid both <NEG> kept smiling like some idiots on a game show </NEG> . the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left . <NEG> buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies </NEG> . tell them the show is great and smile a lot . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : september 29 , 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .
