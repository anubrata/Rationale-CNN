everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and <NEG> there is nothing new presented here </NEG> . wincer <NEG> displays absolutely no skill </NEG> in setting up an exciting action sequence . billy zane is <NEG> wooden </NEG> as the hero . kristy swanson is <NEG> given very little to do , and does very little with it </NEG> . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is <NEG> one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie </NEG> . only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but <NEG> this is so poorly played out </NEG> you won't even care . about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . <NEG> this is not a good movie </NEG> .
