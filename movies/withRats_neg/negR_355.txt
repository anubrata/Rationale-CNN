bob the happy bastard's quickie review : the odd couple ii grumpy old men , it ain't . hell , my fellow americans , it ain't . walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for <NEG> an even more worn out vehicle </NEG> than any of their films over the past few years . odd couple ii <NEG> feels terribly generic </NEG> , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale . that's like repackaging campbell's soup in a generic food can , really . how writer neil simon could've made <NEG> such a horrible mistake </NEG> in screen writing is beyond me . throughout the movie , <NEG> i really didn't laugh once . honestly . </NEG> i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn't seem funny to me . and that car rolling off the cliff ? the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it . <NEG> and the ending gets all super-mushy , too </NEG> . in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a <NEG> wasted </NEG> jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon's daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands . ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i'm sure . consider it a hospitable gester , <NEG> you won't waste your time renting this muck </NEG> .
