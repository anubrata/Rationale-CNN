movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both . on the red planet , <NEG> they fail entirely </NEG> . in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . <NEG> this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be . after some mumbo-jumbo </NEG> about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship <NEG> falls apart almost as fast as the movie does </NEG> . the ground crew of people <NEG> you couldn't care less about </NEG> is trapped on the surface without food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog . the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer . attempting to graft " 2001 " esque space mysticism with " terminator " robot horror , first time director antony hoffman <NEG> can't seem to figure out what's going on . neither can we . </NEG> didn't he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ? couldn't he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ? <NEG> there are so many mis-steps </NEG> . every opportunity to create dynamic tension is <NEG> thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction </NEG> . why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen . <NEG> two hours later , they're still waiting </NEG> . despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .
