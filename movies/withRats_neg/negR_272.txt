i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . what used to be intelligent about his films is <NEG> hopelessly stale </NEG> here . the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . but <NEG> where are the thrills ? the laughs ? both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . and what a shame that is </NEG> . i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that <NEG> will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign </NEG> . or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . i still have my faith , but <NEG> i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past </NEG> . the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this <NEG> distressingly hollow </NEG> black comedy that <NEG> goes down like a flat soft drink </NEG> . in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . the plot <NEG> is a big problem </NEG> here . material that could have been enjoyable is <NEG> rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling </NEG> on the part of the director . the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . in the morning . . . how convenient ! the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . besides <NEG> pointless sub-plots </NEG> involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , <NEG> horribly wasted </NEG> ) , <NEG> there is little by way of actual progress . there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved </NEG> . the humor is <NEG> completely inconsistent </NEG> . after many of the jokes , <NEG> the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze </NEG> . you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . <NEG> a moment like that never arises </NEG> . williamson also does a handsome job of <NEG> wasting some of the key supporting players </NEG> , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . while <NEG> everything is pretty lifeless </NEG> , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but <NEG> anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script </NEG> . mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that <NEG> flounder in boredom </NEG> . if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be ` <NEG> disappointing </NEG> ' . basically , kevin williamson is <NEG> his worst enemy </NEG> here . his <NEG> uneventful direction </NEG> prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .
