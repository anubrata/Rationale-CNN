i think we should , as responsible citizens , all get together and <NEG> stop jim carrey from making another movie . he's changing the cinema as we know it -- and for the worst </NEG> . i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues , epilogues , etc . the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day <NEG> . ho , ho . </NEG> normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr . carrey suceeds in making it <NEG> unwatchable </NEG> . i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing . <NEG> grinding </NEG> doesn't begin to describe . it <NEG> pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably </NEG> that , if you are a normal person , <NEG> you leave feeling sick </NEG> . when it's not trying to be funny , it's trying to be melodramatic--but <NEG> it's just annoying , stupid and sappy </NEG> . at best . this movie is intended to make people laugh , yes , not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound . but , <NEG> it fails on every possible level . it fails to be funny . it fails to be insightful . it fails to be suspensful . it fails to be fun </NEG> . they should pay people to see it . it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles , for having lived . if you go in with the intention of coming out alive , please make sure that you are overly fond of boob , fart , pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane . yes , literally insane . stark , raving mad . <NEG> it is boring , stupid , melodramatic and in the end ugly </NEG> . i reccemond it strongly . to ed wood .
