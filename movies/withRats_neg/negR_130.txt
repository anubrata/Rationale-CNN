<NEG> i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently </NEG> . i've just never experienced anything in my life which was <NEG> so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " </NEG> . after all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth " then i saw cruel intentions . in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios . the very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer <NEG> who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail </NEG> . but it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation . <NEG> i'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity </NEG> . now you're probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? " the answer is no . <NEG> it's actually much worse </NEG> . watching the cast of <NEG> this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound . and then pouring acid on the salt </NEG> . i don't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but <NEG> the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom </NEG> . from that opening scene , where <NEG> boring actor </NEG> ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don't remember because <NEG> i had practically fallen asleep </NEG> ; cruel intentions <NEG> is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits </NEG> .
