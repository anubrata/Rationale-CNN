" mission to mars " is <NEG> one of those annoying movies </NEG> where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . " mission " * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it's <NEG> too little , too late </NEG> . " mission " has some good ideas , but they get lost in the <NEG> unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue </NEG> , and spate of good actors <NEG> wasted in cardboard-cutout roles </NEG> . i'm sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until <NEG> it loses all its charm </NEG> . glances don't communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . <NEG> a lot of it is a cliched glorification </NEG> of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall <NEG> kind of crap </NEG> . there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then <NEG> we're so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over </NEG> . great design , good intentions , but no cigar . if you're not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , <NEG> don't waste your eight bucks on this </NEG> . and what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . <NEG> that's just unforgiveable </NEG> .
