i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . . i got it . well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching <NEG> a bad movie . this movie really sucks . it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! ! </NEG> for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ? jackie shroff <NEG> looked really stupid </NEG> with his steven seagal ponytail . <NEG> the songs are bad , the acting is bad </NEG> ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is <NEG> the worst of all </NEG> . the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever <NEG> just made me want to throw up . i didn't even finish the movie . . . i couldn't take it anymore </NEG> . note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff . aditya panscholi is the sidekick again . ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little . he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though <NEG> it wasn't his best </NEG> , was the only saving grace of the movie )
