in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . <NEG> pacing of the film is simply too slow </NEG> to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety <NEG> have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments </NEG> . low budget also becomes <NEG> painfully visible </NEG> , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . <NEG> unfortunately , this film has too little </NEG> of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have <NEG> all the reasons to feel disappointed </NEG> . instead , they would have to settle with <NEG> pointless , slow scenes </NEG> involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . all of those <NEG> definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time </NEG> .
