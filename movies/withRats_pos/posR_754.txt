kolya is <POS> one of the richest films i've seen in some time </POS> . zdenek sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor ( who's likely to remain so ) , who finds his life as a czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five-year old boy that he's taking care of . though it ends rather abruptly-- and i'm whining , 'cause i wanted to spend more time with these characters-- the acting , writing , and production <POS> values are as high as , if not higher than , comparable american dramas </POS> . this father-and-son delight-- sverak also wrote the script , while his son , jan , directed-- <POS> won a golden globe for best foreign language film </POS> and , a couple days after i saw it , walked away an oscar . in czech and russian , with english subtitles .
