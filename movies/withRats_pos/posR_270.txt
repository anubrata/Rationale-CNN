this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths . there is marc renton ( who narrates ) , spud ( the dim-witted one ) sick boy ( the sean connery obsessive ) , and begbee ( the violence obsessive ) . powered by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggy pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed . . . ) the film follows renton who gets clean , gets back into heroin and gets clean again . <POS> some of the wit in this movie is sharp </POS> and pulp fiction-esque , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheets ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film starts out on a comic note , it takes a sharp term in the middle , and becomes almost depressing . the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title . i can honestly say that this is <POS> one of the best movies i have ever seen </POS> . it is <POS> an obscure gem that has been over shadowed </POS> in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4 . the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors . this is <POS> a very original film </POS> , as far as films go today . it definetly <POS> deserves multiple viewings </POS> ( partly because of the slang and accents ) jeremy dennison mr . orange@centuryinter . net
