oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . <POS> there's something almost majestic about the process </POS> : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . sir anthony hopkins is <POS> staggering </POS> and plays nixon with <POS> incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture </POS> of the 37th american president . joan allen's <POS> magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette </POS> . she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . the rest of the cast is <POS> equally magnificent </POS> , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . <POS> everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined </POS> . he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . <POS> the flashy editing </POS> by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's <POS> rich cinematography </POS> and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . still it's <POS> an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making </POS> .
