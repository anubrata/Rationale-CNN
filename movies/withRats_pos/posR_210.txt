i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . breakdown , then , <POS> is something of a surprise </POS> . russell <POS> gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast </POS> , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . russell , as mentioned earlier , <POS> is very good in his role </POS> , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . j . t . walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is <POS> terrific </POS> ; he is <POS> one of the best of the fine batch of character actors </POS> hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow <POS> is on the right track here </POS> . the reason <POS> he makes such a great villain </POS> is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which <POS> makes the plot that much more believable </POS> . breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , <POS> a great thriller with believable characters </POS> and scenes that do , indeed , <POS> have viewers on the edge of their seats </POS> . one of <POS> the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time </POS> .
