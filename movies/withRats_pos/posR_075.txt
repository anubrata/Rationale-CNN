well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! daylight is <POS> a great disaster movie </POS> . if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already . a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! >from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to <POS> some of the best camera work and action staged </POS> . most all the action is plausible and will <POS> hold you at the edge of your seat </POS> . there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . there is no general antagonist in this film , but <POS> the action and suspense </POS> makes you forget all about that . daylight <POS> is a great film </POS> , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought <POS> it was worth every penny </POS> . the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . rob cohen ( dragonheart ) <POS> does a great job </POS> with this film .
