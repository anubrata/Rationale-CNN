taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is <POS> entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride </POS> . liman , who also photographed the film , <POS> has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good </POS> . the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular <POS> looking pretty good </POS> . there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . <POS> the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life </POS> . holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) <POS> displays much talent here </POS> , and despite her largely limited screen time <POS> manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature </POS> . askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but <POS> the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it </POS> . <POS> the real standout </POS> is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her <POS> refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining </POS> . also <POS> entertaining </POS> timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives <POS> an nice evil performance </POS> . the script , written john august , <POS> is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes </POS> . it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . the stories are <POS> largely satisfying </POS> , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . still , <POS> the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it </POS> . it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one <POS> is pretty decent </POS> . unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , <POS> which is a plus </POS> . go is <POS> a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters </POS> who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) they are who they are and they stay that way . go <POS> is great fun , and a worthy follow up </POS> from the director of swingers . ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . erm , go to go , i guess .
