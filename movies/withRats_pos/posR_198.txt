bob the happy bastard's quickie review : rush hour so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . but , <POS> at last , someone has a different take on the matter </POS> , and it's director brett rainer . rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter . of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker . what makes rush hour <POS> work so damn well </POS> is <POS> the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker </POS> . tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( " i'm michael jackson , you tito . " ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as <POS> some terrific fight scenes </POS> . the story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao . at least <POS> it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized </POS> . a particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is <POS> funny and energetic at the same time </POS> . and the finale's <POS> a real treat </POS> as well . . . chan delivers <POS> yet another fantastic stunt </POS> for the fans with a 10-story drop . rush hour is <POS> just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night of the week </POS> . just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and you'll be fine- drunken master ii this ain't .
