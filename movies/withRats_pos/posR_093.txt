" footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . and i hate to admit it ; <POS> i fell for it </POS> . the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . so <POS> why did i enjoy it so much ? </POS> for one thing , <POS> the cast is great </POS> . kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort . yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . and he never broods . the rest of the cast is <POS> equally impressive </POS> . john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . <POS> another nice touch is the music </POS> . we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that's not true at all . the title track , performed by kenny loggins , <POS> is upbeat and fun </POS> . during the final sequence , <POS> i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing </POS> . of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . anyway , " footloose " is <POS> a charming little surprise </POS> . <POS> don't let the premise prevent you from watching it </POS> . <POS> it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you </POS> .
