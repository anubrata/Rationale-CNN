" the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan <POS> exquisitely writes and directs </POS> . although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still <POS> manages to give audiences a moving experience </POS> . based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy . it's all work and no play with him . while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . unfortunately the two break up . this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . while this may sound straight forward it's not . it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . all this may sound like a drag , but <POS> it really captures your interest </POS> . with <POS> great performances </POS> by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore <POS> who definitely deserves an oscar </POS> because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , <POS> she had the most passion for , and you can see why . the story was also well written </POS> thanks to neil jordan . even though i didn't read the book , <POS> there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive </POS> . what's so moving about it you ask ? the tragedy of it all . it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses . there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . <POS> also a notable was the superb direction </POS> by neil jordan . i'd have to say <POS> this is his finest achievement to date </POS> , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par . it just never did anything for me , until now . when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . this is <POS> definitely one of the best films </POS> of 99 , and had <POS> some of the best acting </POS> , most notably by moore . not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .
