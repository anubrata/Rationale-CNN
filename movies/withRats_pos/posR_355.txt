to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan <POS> is a whole new world </POS> . the mouse factory's latest feature <POS> is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters </POS> . mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , <POS> it is a lively tale </POS> of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that <POS> even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy </POS> . the movie <POS> utilizes a strong corps </POS> of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including <POS> the wonderful </POS> ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . <POS> also adding to the proceedings </POS> is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but <POS> it's a crowd pleasing performance </POS> , especially for the youngsters . the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , <POS> but mulan's are winners </POS> . the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel <POS> fit nicely into the plot </POS> . the overall score by jerry goldsmith <POS> also is a plus </POS> . mulan <POS> is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame </POS> . at about 85 minutes , mulan <POS> moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end </POS> . mulan <POS> will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain </POS> . also , it is hoped that <POS> the success of mulan </POS> , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
