i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . <POS> it is cute , funny , suspenseful </POS> ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . one of the bad guys <POS> was a surprise </POS> . the pace is fast enough , there are some " action " scenes . i think that this is <POS> a reasonable family summer movie </POS> for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . julia roberts and nick nolte <POS> are fine separately and together </POS> . <POS> i really identified with </POS> the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . she could use some highlights . <POS> they both do fine with their roles </POS> : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe . they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . <POS> i like the one story focus </POS> . other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . basically <POS> this movie is reasonably fun </POS> . there is a serious mystery to solve , and <POS> i enjoyed following a fun couple </POS> solving the mystery . it is <POS> a pleasant change of pace </POS> from movies that take themselves seriously . i do give successful comedy high marks .
