set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff's murder . when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . in the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . with the rumpo's past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! sid james , with an american accent , is <POS> perfect </POS> as the rumpo kid , a part which <POS> suits him down to the ground </POS> . jim dale <POS> provides one of his best carry on performances </POS> as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is <POS> very effective in her role </POS> as the revengeful daughter . other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . big heap is the local indian leader and <POS> the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in </POS> even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . joan sims provides <POS> useful and amusing support </POS> as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee's performance is rather poor . kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the 'judge' . even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite . a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . the death count is the highest of any carry on film . <POS> sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable </POS> . the songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie's song ) are <POS> very impressive </POS> . a strange but therefore <POS> very interesting carry on film </POS> . not the best of its kind but it is certainly <POS> the most distinctive film of the series </POS> .
