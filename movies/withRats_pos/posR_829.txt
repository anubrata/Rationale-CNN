albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time . with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and <POS> does so in a positive way </POS> . while this may not be his finest work , " the muse " still <POS> shakes up some delightful humor </POS> . in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say . in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past . he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career . so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment . the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end . it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a <POS> hilarious </POS> manner . speaking of brooks , he was <POS> absolutely hysterical </POS> as a screenwriter . every time he graces the screen , <POS> i can't help but start laughing </POS> . albert has <POS> a very unique sense of humor </POS> that makes him a very likeable character . the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone . she wasn't likeable at all . brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through . in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak . luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap . it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because " the muse " had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy . on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also <POS> charming </POS> as brook's wife . <POS> she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress </POS> , because <POS> she has that charisma </POS> that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in . the funniest moments in " the muse " in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese . i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary . <POS> it was just plain hilarious </POS> . it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas . <POS> brilliant </POS> move by brooks . as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before . unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather <POS> a witty and humorous look </POS> at hollywood . " bowfinger " had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but " the muse " still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour . by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it . for once <POS> i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving </POS> , even with some flaws . thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort . i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .
