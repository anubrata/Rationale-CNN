mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode , " love's labour lost " , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies . so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , <POS> she does not disappoint </POS> . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . despite <POS> a few good images </POS> , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , <POS> it begins to take off </POS> . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . this is when leder <POS> starts to show her true stuff </POS> . she starts us off with <POS> a nifty little car chase </POS> as an appetizer . then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . then that leads us to <POS> the brilliant final showdown </POS> on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is <POS> a natural at creating suspense </POS> . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in <POS> her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking </POS> . nicole kidman is <POS> an intelligent female action hero </POS> . you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is <POS> a real movie star </POS> . many of you may have hated him as batman , but <POS> this guy is for real </POS> . he <POS> has a natural screen presence </POS> , and <POS> an ingratiating personality </POS> . <POS> he'll be around for a while </POS> . dreamworks is off to <POS> a satisfying start </POS> with peacemaker .
