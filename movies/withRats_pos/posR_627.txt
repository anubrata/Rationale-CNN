i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze . i liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) . <POS> i typically enjoy myself </POS> when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash . wild things is <POS> the best sleazy film i've ever seen </POS> . it's <POS> filled with great performances </POS> , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards . criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic . wild things is <POS> a film that succeeds in its endeavors </POS> , but <POS> i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies </POS> . i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal . i imagine that this shows . it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known . i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here . i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida . in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges . all of this happens fairly early in the film . and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted . i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked . wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but <POS> it is so fun to see where the story takes us </POS> that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks . i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers . i'd give the preview four stars . it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since . over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong . the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets . but i'm not here to talk about the preview . i'm here to talk about denise richards . now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that <POS> every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can </POS> . of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and flawless body . . . but <POS> i thought she did a great job acting </POS> , too ( stop laughing ) . no , richards is truly a find--she is <POS> talented , and always convincing </POS> in this film . this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future . the other actors are good , too . dillon is <POS> as suave as ever </POS> ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) . bacon <POS> does a good job acting </POS> all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer . neve campbell <POS> gives the most layered performance of all of them </POS> , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex . for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived . that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film . each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's <POS> too smart to resist </POS> . there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , <POS> so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful . i loved it </POS> .
